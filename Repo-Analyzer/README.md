# Repo Analyzer - README

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** This repository contains a Python tool that analyzes a Git repository and consolidates its codebase into a single file. This consolidated file can then be easily passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) for various tasks, such as generating improved documentation (like README files), suggesting code changes, or answering questions about the repository's structure and functionality.

**Target Audience:**  This tool is designed for developers who want to leverage the power of LLMs to understand and improve their codebases.  Basic familiarity with the command line is helpful.

## 2. Reasons for Creation (Original Repository)

This is the initial version of the Repo Analyzer.  It's designed to bridge the gap between complex codebases and the analytical capabilities of LLMs.

## 3. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+:**  Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Git:** Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  Needed if you're cloning a repository directly from a URL.
* **Virtual Environment (Recommended):**  `venv` (built into Python 3) or `conda`.
*  **An LLM of your Choice:**  You'll need access to an LLM service after you've generated the consolidated code file.

## 4. Quick Start Guide

**Setup Options:**

**Option 1: Using `venv` (Recommended):**

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to where you cloned this repository (e.g., `cd path/to/your/RepoAnalyzer`).
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  We'll create a virtual environment called "repo_env".  Think of it as a contained space for this project's dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv repo_env 
   ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** This steps "turns on" the virtual environment.
   - Windows: `repo_env\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source repo_env/bin/activate`  (You'll see `(repo_env)` at the beginning of your command prompt when it's activated.)
4. **Install Dependencies:**  Now that the virtual environment is active, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Option 2: Using `conda`:**

1. **Make sure you have `conda` installed:** If not, you can download Miniconda (a minimal installer for `conda`) from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the repository directory.
3. **Create a Conda Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n repo_env python=3.9  # Or your desired Python version
   ```
4. **Activate the Conda Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate repo_env
   ```
5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


**Option 3: Using Anaconda:**

1. **Make sure you have Anaconda installed:** If not, download it from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. **Open the Anaconda Navigator application.**
3. **Create a new environment:**  Give it a name (e.g., "repo_env") and select your desired Python version.
4. **Open a terminal within the Anaconda environment.** (You can do this directly from the Navigator).
5. **Navigate to the repository directory in the terminal.**
6. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
